# ArchiteX

ArchiteX is a full-stack starter project that combines a C# CleanArchitecture backend with a Next.js frontend (using pnpm) and optional mobile projects (Expo and Flutter). This template comes preconfigured with built-in authentication, database integration, and a modular project structure, enabling you to rapidly kickstart new projects with best practices already in place.
